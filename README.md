# Car Price Prediction Using Multiple Linear Regression

## Project Description
This project uses Multiple Linear Regression to predict car prices based on multiple features such as engine size, horsepower, mileage, etc. The goal is to understand how different features affect car prices and to create a predictive model.

## Dataset
The dataset contains various car attributes:
- Engine Size
- Horsepower
- Mileage
- Age
- Price (Target Variable)

## Methodology
1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
   - Handling missing values
   - Removing duplicates
   - Handling outliers
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
   - Visualizing distributions
   - Checking correlations
3. Multiple Linear Regression Model
   - Splitting dataset into training and testing
   - Training the model
4. Model Evaluation
   - Metrics: R², MSE, RMSE
   - Visualizations of predicted vs actual values

## Tools Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Results
The model performs well in predicting car prices, achieving an acceptable R² score and low RMSE.
